# binjapack

A tiny [Binary Ninja](https://binary.ninja) plugin to help you quickly pack addresses into **p32/p64** format while solving **pwn CTFs**.

Instead of manually typing `struct.pack("<I", addr)` or `struct.pack("<Q", addr)` in Python every time, you can right-click an instruction or address in Binary Ninja and instantly see/copy the packed forms.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Pack instruction address** into both **p32** (4 bytes, little-endian) and **p64** (8 bytes, little-endian).
- Output formats:
  - Python-ready `b"\xde\xad\xbe\xef"` style
  - Hex-escaped string `\xef\xbe\xad\xde`
- Two usage modes:
  - **View in Log** â†’ prints results into Binary Ninjaâ€™s Log console.
  - **Show Report** â†’ opens a plain-text popup with the packed values.
